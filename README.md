# Overview of Methods, from Data Acquisition to Output of Trained Model

All code associated with this project can be found in this repository separated by function, but this document will act as an overarching summary of all work completed. While the data will not be provided here, it can be acquired from the [ADNI Database](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) with permission. Upon download of the data a CSV with identifying information for each image is also made avaliable. This can be found [here](https://github.com/Newber0/Automatic-Alzheimers-Brain-MRI-Classification/blob/main/Data_Index.csv) in the case of this project.

We obtained our data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We selected T1 weighted 3T images including AD, MCI, and CN labelled data. All available data in this category was taken from the ADNI Database. A CSV file containing all information for each image was provided upon download of the data. The data was downloaded from different sources, so these files were combined into a master excel file.
