# Obtain data from ADNI Website
We obtained our data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We selected T1 weighted 3T images including AD, MCI, and CN labelled data. Selected this data from all available sources. A CSV file and XLSX file containing all information for each image was provided upon download of the data. The data was downloaded from different sources, so these files were combined into a master excel file.
