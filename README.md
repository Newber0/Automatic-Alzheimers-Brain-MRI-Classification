# Overview of Methods, from Data Acquisition to Output of Trained Model

All code associated with this project can be found in this repository separated by function, but this document will act as an overarching summary of all work completed. While the data will not be provided here, it can be acquired from the [ADNI Database](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) with permission. Upon download of the data a CSV with identifying information for each image is also made avaliable. This can be found [here](https://github.com/Newber0/Automatic-Alzheimers-Brain-MRI-Classification/blob/main/Data_Index.csv) in the case of this project.

# <a name="Obtain_data_from_ADNI_Website"></a>Obtain data from ADNI Website

We obtained our data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We selected T1 weighted 3T images including AD, MCI, and CN labelled data. All available data in this category was taken from the ADNI Database. A CSV file containing all identifying information for each image was provided upon download of the data. The data was downloaded from different sources, so these files were combined into a master excel file which can be found [here](https://github.com/Newber0/Automatic-Alzheimers-Brain-MRI-Classification/blob/main/Data_Index.csv). 

# <a name="Preprocessing_of_File_Structure"></a>Preprocessing of File Structure

The downloaded file structure was organized by date, patient, and preprocessing types. All data was removed and placed into one file to reduce complicated file parsing. 

Each file contained all identifying information for that file including the file structure as well as a unique image ID. All files were renamed to include only the image ID. This was accomplished with the simple line of code below.

```
import os

filepath = '/Data_Directory/'
# '/Data_Directory/' is wherever the data is stored.

for f in os.listdir(filepath):

  # splitting filename into components
  file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(f)
  ADN, REDUNDANT, ID = file_name.split('I')

  # mild formatting to ensure names match up
  ID = ID.strip()
  file_ext = file_ext.strip()
  
  # Renaming of files
  new_name = ('{}{}'.format(ID,file_ext))
  os.rename((filepath + f), (filepath + new_name)) 
)
```
For example, this code renamed all files from something like ADNI_136_S_0579_MR_SmartBrain_br_raw_20080121170059746_1_S44769_I87960.nii to 87960.nii.

All files contain two capital I characters, first as part of 'ADNI' and second preceeding the Image ID, therefore the filename is split by this and renaming is simple

# <a name="Brain_Extraction_using_ROBEX"></a>Brain Extraction using ROBEX and further Preprocessing

The tool used for this step was the Robust Brain Extraction package was used which can be found [here](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/robex). This removes the tissue surrounding and including the skull. Isolating exclusively brain tissue in an effective manner dramatically increase the accuracy of the neural network. The code for this process can be found below.
```
cd /Working_Dir/

for f in /ROBEX_InputData/* ; do
	./ROBEX/runROBEX.sh /InputData/$f /ROBEX_OutputData/$f ;
	done
```
This is not run using python for simplicities sake on our end. The UBC ARC Sockeye system was used for all computation of this project and compatibility issues dictate we do this.

# <a name="Registration_to_Template_using_ANTs"></a>Registration to Template using ANTs

Registration of the image to normalised space was carried out using the ANTsPy package (Python Version of ANTs). Here is the [Documentation](https://antspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [GitHub download](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) package. This is a multistage process requiring registration to a template using the various methods we are interested in, and segmentation of these images into grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). First we will focus on Registration.

Registration methods that we tested include Translation, Affine, ElasticSyN, SyNRA, SyNAGGRo and TVMSQ. These methods range from least to most aggressive, roughly in this order. The code for each of these registrations can be found in this repository, however the difference is minimal for our purposes so SyNRA will be used as an Example here.
